# CFTC Commitments of Traders — Gold Futures Positioning

This project analyzes **CFTC Commitments of Traders (COT)** data for **Gold futures**, focusing on how different trader categories position themselves over time.

Using the **Disaggregated Futures Only** report via the CFTC’s public API, the analysis computes and visualizes **net positions** (long − short) for key market participants.

---

## What this project does
- Pulls regulatory futures data from the **CFTC public reporting API** (Socrata / SODA)
- Filters to **Gold futures** contracts
- Cleans and structures weekly positioning data
- Engineers **net exposure metrics** for:
  - Producer / Merchant
  - Swap Dealers
  - Managed Money
- Visualizes positioning trends through time
